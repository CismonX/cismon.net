I opened a column in the Laravel-China community, [*PHP Extension Cookbook*](https://laravel-china.org/php-extension-cookbook). It's not much, but if you look forward to learning PHP extension development, this column can be of help.

I've just posted the very first article yesterday, mainly explaining how to write config.m4 script for your extension. And there's going to be many more.

If there's something wrong or badly explained in the articles, feel free to email me for correction. And if you're also adept at developing PHP extensions, you're welcome to contribute to this column.

Have a great time hacking with PHP, y'all :)
